# React + Redux Toolkit + TypeScript + Vite

This project shows the basic principles about how to implement Redux and Typescript in a react application. 
It focuses on how to set up the Redux store with the hooks in order to get lean the code when it comes to deal with typescript.
It also sets up slicers, slector and the thunks.

This repository is mostly a reminder to my self, a place where I can find the main Redux tooklkit concepts and use in my project, in case
I'll end up to forget any of them.
